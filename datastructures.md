Data Structures
===============

## Dynamic Array
* A variable size array that allows elements to be added or removed at random locations
* Allocated at runtime, might need to be expanded however

##### Complexity
* Search: O(n)
* Indexing: O(1)
* Insert: O(1) at end, O(n) otherwise
* Delete: O(1) at end, O(n) otherwise

## Linked List
* Items in a linked list can be easily added or removed, and the size of a linked list does not have to be predefined
